            				<h3><p>• In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</p></h3><p> My name is Simon Lee from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I am a Project Manager in the IT division of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). I manage projects such as Mobile Cash Register Solution, Card Holder Data Handling, Pinpad Application Upgrade (NFC), etc. I also lead a team of IT professionals to handle application change management of over 600 retail stores of the LCBO. </p><h3><p>
• Why are you taking this course? </p></h3><p>I have worked as a professional programmer for 6 years after college.  I have steered away from programming and became a project manager in the last 3 years.  I am taking this course to brush up my Web programming knowledge and to learn PHP.    </p>
<h3><p>
• What previous experience do you have with programming?</p></h3><p> I studied computer science in college.  Throughout my career, I have worked on VB.net, ASP.net, C#, AJAX , CSS, HTML, Perl, batch scripting, unix shell scripting and VB scripts.  I also worked with database such as MySQL, Microsoft  SQL, Oracle, etc.</p>
<h3><p>
• Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform? </p></h3><p>I own a Mac and a PC and I am taking this course with my Windows 7, 32 bit PC.  </p>
<h3><p>
• Anything else we should know? </p></h3><p>I also have working knowledge of Adobe Photoshop but I have a very bad sense of color arrangement, desktop publishing, content lay out.  I have started to learn Objective-C in my spare time when I am not wrenching on my cars.
